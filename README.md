# Project: Data Visualization of Bird Strikes (2000 – 2011)

## About the Project

Transport and communication are crucial in analytics, especially regarding environmental impacts and safety in urban areas. 
Increasing vehicles and people demand innovative solutions, with artificial intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) gaining recognition. 

A significant threat to aviation safety is bird strikes, which are collisions between birds and aircraft, including wildlife strikes involving bats and ground animals.
 Bird strikes can cause severe damage, particularly to jet engines, leading to engine failure and potential fatal accidents. These incidents are most likely during take-off, climb, approach, and landing due to higher bird activity at lower altitudes. 

FAA data from 2000 to 2011 highlights the frequency and impact of bird strikes, emphasizing the need for effective mitigation strategies to enhance aviation safety.
